* Allow for multiple notes. A tabbed interface would be really useful,
  since there are no titles for notes. Not all objects would necessarily
  need multiple notes. Determine which ones should and shouldn't.
* Drag and drop should display the icon we are dragging instead of just
  the default icon.  Nautilus does this very effectively, and GTK has
  support for this.
* Provide an "import" of a gramps package. Not too difficult to do this,
  since there is already a ReadTarFile class which will unpackage the
  file. Needs have an interface built around it.
* Catch uncaught exceptions at the top level, notifiy the user, and 
  store the results in a file that can be emailed. Have the start of
  this with the gramps.err file, but most users don't realize that 
  this file has been created. Some type of notification is needed.
* Speed up the reading of the database. The python XML routines are not
  as fast as I would like, and it can take a minute or so to read a
  large database. This is way too slow.
* Finish the generic load of revision control interfaces to allow a
  revision control plugin system. Most of the work is already done.
* Extend the gramps package exporting to export to a ISO-9660 CD-ROM
  image. Thumbnails would need to be exported for this as well, since
  the CD-ROM would be read-only after burning.
* Disable the save buttons if gramps database is marked read-only. Disable 
  the adding of media objects as well, since this will cause gramps to
  try to create a thumbnail in a readonly database.
* OpenOffice zip file is not handled very gracefully.  Uses the "system"
  call to generate the zip file using the hard coded path of /usr/bin/zip. 
  Python 2.0 provides a zip interface, so this may need to hold off until 
  the move is made to Python 2.0.
* Sort all lists
* Implement a "Preferred Family" concept for each person. Currently, the 
  alternate family/main family is kind of awkward, since the main family
  must now be the birth family. Many people would view an adopted family
  as the main family.
* Startup tips.
* And a whole lot more....
