* More complete GEDCOM import and export.  The current GEDCOM parse is
  regular expression based, and not to sophisticated.  It probably won't
  take much to confuse it badly.
* Dates do not understand the concept of between
* Dates do not understand alternate calendars
* The GUI interface is not clean or consistant.  It needs a considerable
  amount of work.
* There are no sophisticated functions at all yet, such as merging of 
  databases or finding duplicate people.  
* There are no logic rules yet, such as warning if a parent's birthday 
  is after a child's.
* I'm not happy with the mechanism for the selection of alternate parents.  
  It works, but is extremely clumsy and non-intuitive
* OpenOffice zip file is not handled very gracefully.  Uses the "system"
  call to generate the zip file using the hard coded path of /usr/bin/zip. 
  Python 2.0 provides a zip interface, so this may need to hold off until 
  the move is made to Python 2.0.
* Really need a generic OutputFormat class, that can be reused in all the
  report generators.  Derived classes can target OpenOffice, HTML, LaTeX,
  KOffice, AbiWord, etc.
* And a whole lot more....
