    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
    GRAMPS is an acronym for the Genealogical Research and Analysis
    Management Programming System.  It was conceived under the concept
    that most genealogy programs were designed to provide the
    researcher the capability to input information related to a
    particular family tree.  Most of these programs have allowed for
    the arranging and storing of information consistent with the
    GEDCOM standards.  They usually provide a means for displaying
    descendant or ancestral relationships by means of graphical
    displays, charts, or reports.  These may be augmented with
    pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most provide for
    inputting data on unconnected individuals/families that may or may
    not have a relationship to the primary surname being researched.
    Various other enhancements may also be provided in the
    genealogical program that allows for different degrees of
    importing and exporting data from other programs and printing of
    the data contained in the various reports.  GRAMPS, on the other
    hand, attempts to provide all of the common capabilities of these
    programs, but, more importantly, to provide a capability not
    common to these programs.  This is the ability to input any bits
    and pieces of information directly into GRAMPS and
    rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base
    (in any order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research,
    analysis and correlation with the potential of filling
    relationship gaps.  In short, a tool that provides a way to input
    all your research into one place and do your analysis and
    correlation using the speed, power, and accuracy of your computer
    instead of pencils and unmanageable reams of paper.

 <!-- ============= Writing Filters ============================= -->

 <sect1 id="writingfilters">
  <title>Writing Filters</title>
  <para>
   Users can create their own filters and add them to
   <application>GRAMPS</application>.  By adding the filter to the
   user's private filter directory 
   (<filename class="directory">~/.gramps/filters</filename>), 
   the filter will be automatically
   recognized the next time that the program is started.
   </para>
   <sect2 id="createfilter">
    <title>Creating a filter</title>
    <para>
     Filters are written in the <application>python</application>
     language.  Each filter is initialized with the qualifier string.
     The qualifier string passes an additional text string to the
     filter. This string can be used to further qualify the filter.
     For example, if the filter is used to match names, the qualifier
     would be used to provide the name that is being compared against.
    </para>
    <para>
    Each filter is a python class, and should be in its own separate
    module (file). The module should consist of the filter class
    definition, and two functions &mdash; <function>create</function>,
    and <function>need_qualifier</function>.
    </para>
    <para>
    The <function>create</function> function takes a string as its
    only argument, returns a instance of the filter class. The string
    argument is the qualifier string used to provide more specific
    information.
    </para>
    <para>
    The <function>need_qualifier</function> function takes no
    arguments, and returns either a 0 or 1 to indicate if a qualifier
    string is needed by the filter. Regardless of what
    <function>need_qualifier</function> indicates, a text string is
    always passed to the filter and the <function>create</function>
    function.  The value returned by
    <function>need_qualifier</function> indicates to the program
    whether or not the qualifier field in the display should be
    enabled or disabled.
    </para>
    <para>
    The module documentation string (a text string as the first
    statement in the module) is used for the description of the
    module.  This is the description that gets entered into filter
    selection menus.
    </para>
    <para>
    All filters must be derived from the
    <function>Filter.Filter</function> class. The
    <function>__init__</function> task may be overridden, but if so,
    should call the <function>__init__</function> function on the
    <function>Filter.Filter</function> class.  The parent class
    provides the variable <function>self.text</function>, which
    contains the text string passed as the qualifier.
    </para>
    <para>
    All filter classes must define a <function>match</function>
    function. The function takes one argument (other than
    <function>self</function>), which is an object of type
    <function>Person</function> to compare against. The function
    should return a 1 if the person matches the filter, or a zero if
    the person does not.
    </para>

 <!-- ============= Writing Reports ============================= -->

 <sect1 id="writingreports">
  <title>Writing Reports</title>
   <para>
   Users can create their own report generators and add them to
   <application>GRAMPS</application>.  By adding the report generator
   to the user's private filter directory (<filename
   class="directory">~/.gramps/plugins</filename>), the report
   generator filter will be automatically recognized the next time
   that the program is started.
   </para>
   <sect2 id="createreport">
    <title>Creating a report generator</title>
    <para>
     Like filters, report generators are written in the
     <application>python</application> language. Fewer restrictions
     are made on report generators than on filters.  The report
     generator is passed the current <application>GRAMPS</application>
     database and the active person.  The generator needs to take
     special care to make sure that it does not alter the database in
     anyway.
    </para>
    <para>
    The python documentation string (the first text string and first
    statement) of the module is used to name the report generator. The
    string consists of two parts, separated by a forward slash.  The
    first part of the string is the category of the report
    generator. <application>GRAMPS</application> uses this part to
    group similar reports together in the interface. The second part
    of the string is the actual name of the reprot generator, and will
    be displayed in the report menu.
    </para>
    <para>
    A report generator module must supply the
    <function>report</function> function, and can optionally define
    the <function>get_description</function> and
    <function>get_xpm_data</function> functions.  The
    <function>report</function> takes two arguments &mdash; a database
    (of type <function>RelDataBase</function>) and the currently
    selected person (of type <function>Person</function>). The
    <function>report</function> is reponsible for generating the
    actual report.
    </para>
    <para>
    If the <function>get_description</function> is defined, it is used
    to provide a more detailed description of the report. The
    description is used to provide the user with more information in
    the report selection window.  The function takes no arguments, and
    should return a text string.
    </para>
    <para>
    If the <function>get_xpm_data</function> is defined, it is used to
    provide an graphic logo for the report in the report selection
    window.  The function takes no arguments, and should return a list
    of strings containing the XPM file data.  The XPM image should be
    48x48 pixels in size.
    </para>
    <figure id="reportsrc">
    <title>Sample report implementation</title>
    <programlisting>
"Category/report name"

def report(database,person):
   ... actual code ...

def get_description():
   return "A detailed text description of what the report generator does"
