"UNSTABLE Gramps 4.0.0 Alpha1 release.

This is a technology preview to allow plugin writers and packagers-installer 
writers to update their plugins and scripts. This release is not production 
ready, so use for testing!"

It is recommended to use Gramps 4.0.0 with python 3.2 so as to be ready 
for the future (python 2.7 works though). 

The dependencies for Gramps 4.0.0 are _completely_ different than 3.4 due 
to the switch to GObject introspection, and the removal of autotools. So 
only install 4.0.0 if you are certain you can obtain the dependencies, 
see README and INSTALL. 

For linux, in Ubuntu 12.10 you can install 4.0.0, but you will need to 
compile and install osmgpsmap manually to have the maps working (see 
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=GEPS_029:_GTK3-GObject_introspection_Conversion#OsmGpsMap_for_GeographyÂ )
