      <para>Views are the various ways to display different aspects of 
      genealogical information, as described below. Since the relevant 
      information is very broad and non-uniform in both context and modality, 
      it is best to split its display into smaller categories, uniform in 
      context and modality. Each View represents such a split and displays a 
      certain portion of overall available information. Before the detailed 
      description of available Views, let us  guide you through the ways of 
      switching between the Views.</para>

      <sect3 id="people-view">
        <title>People View</title>
	<para>When &app; first opens a database, 
	the View is set to the People View (<xref linkend="side-nofilt-fig"/> 
	and <xref linkend="noside-nofilt-fig"/>). The People View lists 
        individuals whose data is stored in the database.</para>
        
        <para> The individuals are arranged in a tree-like structure, 
        according to their family names. Every family name is a node of the 
        tree. Clicking the arrow on the left of the node will toggle its 
        expansion state. When expanded, the node's contents is listed in the 
        window. When collapsed, the contents is rolled up and not visible. 
        However, all the data is still intact, it is just not being displayed.
        </para>
        
        <para>The People View 
        displays people's <guilabel>Names</guilabel>,

        <sect4 id="filters">
          <title>Filters</title>
	  <para>Genealogical databases may contain huge numbers of people. 
	  Since the long lists are hard for humans to handle,
	  &app; provides a convenient way to limit 
	  the scope of browsing by using the filter. To save screen space, 
	  filter controls may be hidden, depending on the state of 
	  <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item.</para>

	<!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

	  <para>When &app; opens a database, the 
	  filter is set to the trivial filter called <guilabel>All
	  people</guilabel>, i.e. no filtering is in effect. To choose a 
	  filter, use the pop-up <guilabel>Filter</guilabel> menu above the 
	  people's list. Once the filter is chosen, click the 
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button in the upper right corner of the 
	  window. The filtering will take effect upon clicking the 
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. To invert the filtering rule, 
          check the <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box on the left 
	  of <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. </para>
	  
	  <para>Example: To show people without children, choose 
	  <guilabel>People with children</guilabel> filter, then check 
	  <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box, and then click the 
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. To cancel any filtering, set 
	  the filter to <guilabel>All people</guilabel>  
	  and then click the <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. </para>
	  
	  <para>Note: even if the filter controls are not displayed 
	  (<menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item is
	  unchecked), the filtering might still be in place. In other words, 
	  the visibility of the filter controls is not related to the actual 
	  filtering imposed on the list. This may be a cause of confusion, when
	  you enable the filtering and then remove the controls from the
	  display. If in doubt, enable the display of filter controls by 
	  checking <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item and check 
	  what kind of filtering is currently set.</para>

        <sect4 id="alpha-tabs">
          <title>Alphabetical Tabs</title>
	  <para>&app; offers another way of 
	  managing long lists of people -- alphabetical tabs. Upon loading a 
	  database, &app; checks for the stored 
	  family names and breaks the people list into sublists based on the 
	  first letter of their name. The alphabetical tabs are displayed in 
	  the bottom part of the &app; window. 
	  The last tab, <guilabel>Other</guilabel>, stands for unidentified 
	  characters -- all the entries not assigned to any other tab end up 
	  in <guilabel>Other</guilabel>. In particular, people with no family

        <title>Family View</title>
	<para>Family View displays the family information of a currently

	<para>The Active person's data is in the list box in the upper left 
	corner of the window. Directly below it, another box lists the Spouse's
	data, for each relationship of Active person (can be more than one). 
	The double-arrow button to the right of the Active person list box 
	allows you to exchange the currently selected spouse (Current spouse) 
	with the Active person. Double-clicking on the Active person allows the 
	editing of Active person's data. Double-clicking on the Current spouse 
	allows you to edit their relationship information. Shift-clicking on 
        the Current spouse allows the editing of the Current spouse's data.</para>

        <para> To add a new relationship use one of the two upper buttons to the
        right of the spouse box. Click the top one to add a new person to a
        database and to the new relationship. Click the middle one to add a
        person already existing in the database to the new relationship. 
	To remove Current spouse, click the lowest button 
        (<guibutton>-</guibutton>) to the 
	right of the spouse box. Note that removing a spouse from the
        relationship does not remove the person from the database. Most of these
        functions are also available by right-clicking into the spouse box and
        selecting an appropriate items from the context menu. </para>
	
	<para>The parents of both the Active person and the Current spouse 
	are listed in the corresponding list boxes in the right-hand part of 
	the window (Active person's parents on top, Current spouse parents 
	on the bottom). Both list boxes have a set of three buttons on their 
	right side. The <guibutton>+</guibutton> and <guibutton>-</guibutton>
	buttons allow you to add and remove parents of the Active person and the 
	Current spouse, respectively. Clicking the right arrow button
	makes the family in the corresponding list box an active family. 
	That is, it makes the selected Father the Active person, and the 
	selected Mother the Current spouse. Most of these
        functions are also available by right-clicking into the parent box and
        selecting an appropriate items from the context menu. </para>
	
	<para>The bottom list box displays children of the Active person and 
	the Current  Spouse. The Children's list can be ordered by the Birth date 
	in the usual way of clicking on the <guilabel>Birth date</guilabel> column 
	header. In addition to the <guilabel>Name</guilabel>,
	<guilabel>ID</guilabel>, <guilabel>Gender</guilabel>, and
	<guilabel>Birth date</guilabel> columns, the list includes a  
	<guilabel>Status</guilabel> column. The pair of status words reflect the
	relationship between the child and his Father/Mother (such as Birth, Adoption, 
	etc.) Four buttons are available on the right side of the 
	children list box. The top (left arrow) button makes 
	the selected child the Active person. The next two buttons add a new
        child to the family: the upper one adds a new person to the database 
        and to the family, the lower one just adds a person existing in the
        database to the family. Finally, the lowest <guibutton>-</guibutton> 
        button removes the selected child from the family. Note that removing 
        a child from the family does not remove the person from the 
        database. Most of these functions are also available by right-clicking 
        into the children box and selecting an appropriate items from the 
        context menu.</para> 

	<para>The layout of the Family View can be switched from the 
        left-to-right arrangement (shown above) to the top-to-bottom 
        arrangement (shown below). This can be done in the 
        <guilabel>Display</guilabel> section of the

	<para>The Pedigree View helps to visualize the place of the Active

	generations, going back in time from the Active person
	<guilabel>1</guilabel> to his/her parents <guilabel>2</guilabel>, 
	to grandparents <guilabel>3</guilabel>, to great-grandparents 
	<guilabel>4</guilabel>. 
	Each person is denoted by a white box bearing the person's name. 
	The two lines that converge on the box represent ties with the 
	person's Father (top line) and mother (bottom line). Solid lines 
	represent birth relations, while dashed lines represent non-birth 
	relations (such as adoption, step-parenthood, guardianship, etc.). 
	When the mouse moves over the white box, it expands to display the 
	corresponding person's dates of birth and death. When the mouse is 
	placed over the family line, the line changes color to indicate an 
	active link: double-clicking on the line makes the corresponding 
	ancestor the Active person. The display in that case is re-adjusted 
	to show four generations, starting from the newly selected Active 
	person. </para>
	
	<para>The left-hand side of the window shows the left arrow button. 
	Upon clicking, the button expands to the menu listing the children 
	of the Active person. Selecting the menu item makes the corresponding 
	child the Active person. </para>

	<para>The right-hand side of the window shows two right arrow buttons. 
	When the top button is clicked, the Father of the Active person 
	becomes the Active person. Clicking the bottom button makes the Mother of 
	the Active person the Active person. Again, the display is re-adjusted 
	to show four generations, starting from the newly selected Active
