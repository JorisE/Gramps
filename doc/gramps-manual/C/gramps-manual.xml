<!-- ============= Document Body ============================= -->
<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->
  <sect1 id="gramps-intro"> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <para> <application>&app;</application> is a genealogical 
    application. &app; is an acronym for the 
    Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System. To put 
    it shortly, it allows you to store, edit, and research genealogical data 
    using your computer. Its functionality is somewhat common to other 
    genealogical programs. However, <application>&app;</application> offers 
    some unique features. </para> 

    <sect2 id="why-gramps">
      <title>Why &app;?</title>
      <para> <application>&app;</application> was conceived under the concept
      that most genealogy programs were designed to provide the researcher the 
      capability to input information related to a particular family tree.  
      Most of these programs have allowed for the arranging and storing of
      information consistent with the GEDCOM standards. They usually provide
      means for displaying descendant or ancestral relationships by means of
      graphical displays, charts, or reports.  These may be augmented with 
      pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most provide for inputting 
      data on unconnected individuals/families that may or may not have a 
      relationship to the primary surname being researched.  Various other 
      enhancements may also be provided in the genealogical program that 
      allows for different degrees of importing and exporting data from other 
      programs and printing the data contained in the various reports. </para>
      
      <para> <application>&app;</application>, on the other hand, attempts to
      provide all of the common capabilities of these programs, but, more
      importantly, to provide an additional capability of integration not common
      to these programs.  This is the ability to input any bits and pieces of
      information directly into <application>&app;</application> and
      rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base (in any
      order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research, analysis and
      correlation with the potential of filling relationship gaps.  In short, it 
      is a tool that provides a way to input all your research into one place and 
      do your analysis and correlation using the speed, power, and accuracy of 
      your computer instead of pencils and unmanageable reams of paper. </para>

      <sect3 id="zodb-support">
        <title>Optional ZODB support</title> 

      <para>If either StandaloneZODB or Zope is installed on your system, 
      <application>&app;</application> will give you the third option of 
      creating a new ZODB database. You can choose to start your new database 
      in either XML or ZODB format. Both formats have their strong and weak 
      points.</para>

      <para>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and is a human readable
      structured description of data. It could be easily parsed by other 
      programs should the need occur. It stores only the data itself. Its weak 
      point is the relatively low speed of processing large data files. </para>

      <para>ZODB stands for Zope Object Database and provides the full-fledged
      database support. ZODB files are not human readable. They contain a
      certain overhead to assist working with large data structures. However,
      ZODB provides a significant speed-up when the database size is large (over
      a few thousand people). </para>

      <para>Its is hard to tell which format is better, since this is a typical
      trade-off situation. If you are starting your research then you are likely
      to be fine with the regular XML database. If you have tons of data to
      import describing thousands upon thousands of people, then you are
      probably better off with ZODB. </para>

      <para>Views are the various ways to display different aspects of 
      genealogical information, as described below. Since the relevant 
      information is very broad and non-uniform in both context and modality, 
      it is best to split its display into smaller categories, uniform in 
      context and modality. Each View represents such a split and displays a 
      certain portion of overall available information. Before the detailed

          <title>Filters</title>
	  <para>Genealogical databases may contain huge numbers of people. 
	  Since the long lists are hard for humans to handle,
	  <application>&app;</application> provides a convenient way to limit 
	  the scope of browsing by using the Filter. To save screen space, 
	  Filter controls may be hidden, depending on the state of 
	  <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu>

	<!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

	  <para>When <application>&app;</application> opens a database, the 
	  Filter is set to the trivial filter called <guilabel>All
	  people</guilabel>, i.e. no filtering is in effect. To choose a 
	  filter, use the pop-up <guilabel>Filter</guilabel> menu above the 
	  people's list. Once the Filter is chosen, click
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> in the upper right corner of the 
	  window. The filtering will take effect upon clicking
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>. To invert the filtering rule, check 
	  the <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box on the left 
	  of <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. </para>
	  
	  <para>Example: To show people without children, choose 
	  <guilabel>People with children</guilabel> filter, then check 
	  <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box, and then click
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>. To cancel any filtering, set 
	  the filter to <guilabel>All people</guilabel>  
	  and then click <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>. </para>
	  
	  <para>Note: even if the Filter controls are not displayed 
	  (<menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item is
	  unchecked), the filtering might still be in place. In other words, 
	  the visibility of the Filter controls is not related to the actual 
	  filtering imposed on the list. This may be a cause of confusion, when

	individual (active person) or a set of individuals. The options 
	for this report are broken down into contents, privacy, and advanced 
	options. The contents options include the filter (determine the 
	scope of the database to consider), number of generations to consider, 
	destination directory for the images, and a link to the index page.
	Privacy options allow you to omit private records, restrict 
	information on living people, to skip images (either all or those of 
	living people), and to omit comments and text in source information. 
	Finally, the advanced options allow you to include the optional &app; ID, 
	create a GENDEX index, and specify the extension of the resulting
