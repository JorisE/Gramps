<!-- The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: -->

<!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->
<!-- For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the manual that -->
<!-- is written in that desktop time frame is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc. -->
<!-- When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision number of the manual changes -->
<!-- to V3.0, and so on. -->

<!-- ============= Document Body ============================= -->
<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->
  <sect1 id="gramps-intro"> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <para> &app; is a genealogical 
    application. &app; is an acronym for the 
    Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System. To put 
    it shortly, it allows you to store, edit, and research genealogical data 
    using your computer. Its functionality is somewhat common to other 
    genealogical programs. However, &app; offers some unique features. </para> 

    <sect2 id="why-gramps">
      <title>Why &app;?</title>
      <para> &app; was conceived under the concept
      that most genealogy programs were designed to provide the researcher the 
      capability to input information related to a particular family tree.  
      Most of these programs have allowed for the arranging and storing of
      information consistent with the GEDCOM standards. They usually provide
      means for displaying descendant or ancestral relationships by means of
      graphical displays, charts, or reports.  These may be augmented with 
      pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most provide for inputting 
      data on unconnected individuals/families that may or may not have a 
      relationship to the primary surname being researched.  Various other 
      enhancements may also be provided in the genealogical program that 
      allows for different degrees of importing and exporting data from other 
      programs and printing the data contained in the various reports. </para>
      
      <para> &app;, on the other hand, attempts to
      provide all of the common capabilities of these programs, but, more
      importantly, to provide an additional capability of integration not common
      to these programs.  This is the ability to input any bits and pieces of
      information directly into &app; and
      rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base (in any
      order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research, analysis and
      correlation with the potential of filling relationship gaps.  In short, it 
      is a tool that provides a way to input all your research into one place and 
      do your analysis and correlation using the speed, power, and accuracy of 
      your computer instead of pencils and unmanageable reams of paper. </para>
