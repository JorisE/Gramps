<!-- ============= Document Body ============================= -->
<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->
  <sect1 id="gramps-intro"> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <para> The <application>&app;</application> is a genealogical 
    application. &app; is an acronym for the 
    Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System. To put 
    it shortly, it allows you to store, edit, and research genealogical data 
    using your computer. Its functionality is somewhat common to other 
    genealogical programs. However, <application>&app;</application> offers 
    some unique features. </para> 

    <sect2 id="why-gramps">
      <title>Why &app;?</title>
      <para> <application>&app;</application> was conceived under the concept
      that most genealogy programs were designed to provide the researcher the 
      capability to input information related to a particular family tree.  
      Most of these programs have allowed for the arranging and storing of
      information consistent with the GEDCOM standards. They usually provide
      means for displaying descendant or ancestral relationships by means of
      graphical displays, charts, or reports.  These may be augmented with 
      pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most provide for inputting 
      data on unconnected individuals/families that may or may not have a 
      relationship to the primary surname being researched.  Various other 
      enhancements may also be provided in the genealogical program that 
      allows for different degrees of importing and exporting data from other 
      programs and printing the data contained in the various reports. </para>
      
      <para> <application>&app;</application>, on the other hand, attempts to
      provide all of the common capabilities of these programs, but, more
      importantly, to provide an additional capability of integration not common
      to these programs.  This is the ability to input any bits and pieces of
      information directly into <application>&app;</application> and
      rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base (in any
      order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research, analysis and
      correlation with the potential of filling relationship gaps.  In short, a
      tool that provides a way to input all your research into one place and do
      your analysis and correlation using the speed, power, and accuracy of your
      computer instead of pencils and unmanageable reams of paper. </para>

      <sect3 id="zodb-support">
        <title>Optional ZODB support</title> 

      <para>If either StandaloneZODB or Zope is installed on your system, 
      <application>&app;</application> will give you the third option of 
      creating a new ZODB database. You can choose to start your new database 
      in either XML or ZODB format. Both formats have their strong and weak 
      points.</para>

      <para>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and is a human readable
      structured description of data. It could be easily parsed by other 
      programs should the need occur. It stores only the data itself. Its weak 
      point is the relatively low speed of processing large data files. </para>

      <para>ZODB stands for Zope Object Database and provides the full-fledged
      database support. ZODB files are not human readable. They contain a
      certain overhead to assist working with large data structures. However,
      ZODB provides a significant speed-up when the database size is large (over
      few thousand people). </para>

      <para>Its is hard to tell which format is better, since this is a typical
      tradeoff situation. If you are starting your research then you are likely
      to be fine with the regular XML database. If you have tons of data to
      import describing thousands upon thousands of people, then you are
      probably better of with ZODB. </para>

      <para>Views are the various ways to display different aspects of 
      genealogical information, as described below. Since the relevant 
      information is very broad and non-uniform in both context and modality, 
      it is best to split it's display into smaller categories, uniform in 
      context and modality. Each View represents such a split and displays a 
      certain portion of overall available information. Before the detailed

        <title>People View</title>
	<para>When <application>&app;</application> opens a database,

    <!-- ================ Main Window Sub-sub-subsection  -->
        <sect4 id="filters">
          <title>Filters</title>
	  <para>Genealogical databases may contain huge numbers of people. 
	  Since the long lists are hard for humans to handle,
	  <application>&app;</application> provides a convenient way to limit 
	  the scope of browsing by using the Filter. To save screen space, 
	  Filter controls may be hidden, depending on the state of 
	  <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item.</para>

	  <para>When <application>&app;</application> opens a database, the

	  people</guilabel>, i.e. no filtering is in effect. To choose a 
	  filter, use a pop-up <guilabel>Filter</guilabel> menu above the 
	  people's list. Once the Filter is chosen, click
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> in the upper right corner of the 
	  window. The filtering will take effect upon clicking
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>. To invert the filtering rule, check 
	  the <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box on the left 
	  of <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. </para>
	  
	  <para>Example: To show people without children, choose 
	  <guilabel>People with children</guilabel> filter, then check 
	  <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box, and then click
	  <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>. To cancel any filtering, set 
	  the filter to <guilabel>All people</guilabel>

	  <para>Note: even if the Filter controls are not displayed 
	  (<menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item is
	  unchecked), the filtering might still be in place. In other words, 
	  the visibility of the Filter controls is not related to the actual 
	  filtering imposed on the list. This may be a cause of confusion, when
	  you enable the filtering and then remove the controls from the
	  display. If in doubt, enable the display of Filter controls by 
	  checking <menuchoice> <guimenu>View</guimenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> </menuchoice> menu item and check 
	  what kind of filtering is currently set.</para>

	  <para><application>&app;</application> offers another way of

	  Family names and breaks the people list into sublists based on the

	The two lines that converge on the box represent ties with the 
	person's Father (top line) and mother (bottom line). Solid lines 
	represent birth relations, while dashed lines represent non-birth 
	relations (such as adoption, step-parentship, guardianship, etc.). 
	When the mouse moves over the white box, it expands to display the 
	corresponding person's dates of birth and death. When the mouse is 
	placed over the family line, the line changes color to indicate an 
	active link: double-clicking on the line makes the corresponding 
	ancestor the Active person. The display in that case is re-adjusted 
	to show four generations, starting from a newly selected Active 
	person. </para>

	the Active person. This section describes many alternative ways
	to navigate through the database using complex and convenient 
	interface <application>&app;</application> provides. All these ways
	eventually accomplish the same thing, but some are more convenient 
	than others, depending what you are doing in 
	<application>&app;</application> at the moment. </para>

      <sect3 id="gramps-nav-people"> 
        <title>Using People View</title> 
	<para> The most intuitive way to select an active person is 
	to use the People View. When in the People View, just select the
	name of the desired person from the list by clicking that list 
	entry. The person you have selected becomes active. The statusbar 
	updates to reflect the change of the active person. </para>

      <sect3 id="gramps-nav-family"> 
        <title>Using Family View</title> 
	<para> When in the Family View, you can easily navigate between the
	members of the displayed family as follows: </para>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>To make currently selected spouse the active person, 
	click double-arrow button to the right of the active person box.

      <sect3 id="gramps-nav-pedigree"> 
        <title>Using Pedigree View</title> 
	<para> Pedigree View also allows you to move along the family tree. 
	The benefits of this method is that you can see more than one 
	generation of the family tree. Also, you can jump directly from a
	great-grandson to a great-grandfather without going through the 
	intermediate generations. </para>

	<para> Note that after changing the active person in the Pedigree 
	View, the display is re-adjusted to show four generations, starting 
	from a newly selected Active person. When in the Pedigree View, you 
	can easily navigate between the members of the displayed family tree 
	as follows: </para> 

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>To make any displayed person the active person, 
	double click the line that connects to the left side of the
	corresponding box. </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>To make a child of currently active person (if any) 
	the active person, click the left arrow button to the left of the
	corresponding box. If there is more than one child, the button expands
	to the menu listing the children to choose from. </para></listitem> 

	<listitem><para>To move the whole family tree one generation back,
	click on the corresponding right arrow button on the right-hand side 
	of the display area. Clicking the upper button will move the tree 
	along the paternal line. Clicking the lower button will move the 
	tree along the maternal line. </para>

	<para> Clicking either of these buttons is completely equivalent to
	double-clicking the lines connecting to the left of the corresponding
	boxes for father and mother. </para></listitem>

	any method you like. Then choose 
	<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
