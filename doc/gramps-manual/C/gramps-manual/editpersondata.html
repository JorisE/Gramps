      "Education"), a date or date range on which the event occurred,
      the place where the event occurred, and a description of the
      event. A note or a source may also be attached to the event.

      with them. An event may be marked as "Private". When generating
      reports or exporting to other formats, you will be allowed to
      either include or exclude private records. This will allow you
      to limit information provided to others.

CLASS="APPLICATION"

      level of "Normal" is associated with each event. This can be
      changed either up ("High" or "Very High") or down ("Low" or
      "Very Low") to indicate the confidence you have in the
      information. For example, if Aunt Martha thinks that her
      grandmother was born in a particular year, you may wish to mark
      this with a lower level of confidence than if you had a copy of
      her grandmother's birth certificate.
