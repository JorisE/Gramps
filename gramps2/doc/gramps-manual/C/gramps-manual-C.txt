<	<What is GRAMPS?

GRAMPS is an acronym for the Genealogical Research and Analysis Management 
Programming System. To put it shortly, it allows you to store, edit, and 
research genealogical data using your computer. Its functionality is somewhat 
common to other genealogical programs. However, it has some unique features. 

<	<Why GRAMPS?

GRAMPS was conceived under the concept that most genealogy programs 
were designed to provide the researcher the capability to input information 
related to a particular family tree.  Most of these programs have allowed for 
the arranging and storing of information consistent with the GEDCOM standards.  
They usually provide means for displaying descendant or ancestral relationships 
by means of graphical displays, charts, or reports.  These may be augmented 
with pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most provide for inputting 
data on unconnected individuals/families that may or may not have a 
relationship to the primary surname being researched.  Various other 
enhancements may also be provided in the genealogical program that allows for 
different degrees of importing and exporting data from other programs and 
printing the data contained in the various reports.  

GRAMPS, on the other hand, attempts to provide all of the common capabilities 
of these programs, but, more importantly, to provide an additional capability 
of integration not common to these programs.  This is the ability to input any 
bits and pieces of information directly into GRAMPS and rearrange/manipulate 
any/all data events in the entire data base (in any order or sequence) to 
assist the user in doing research, analysis and correlation with the potential 
of filling relationship gaps.  In short, a tool that provides a way to input 
all your research into one place and do your analysis and correlation using 
the speed, power, and accuracy of your computer instead of pencils and 
unmanageable reams of paper.


<Getting Started
	<Starting GRAMPS

You can start GRAMPS either from Application menu or from Command line.

<	<	<Applications Menu
Choose Other->GRAMPS.

<	<	<Command line
Type gramps and press Return. If you would gramps to open a specific database 
or import a specific file on startup, you can give the filename as a command
line argument: gramps <filename.ged> [Return]

<	<Running GRAMPS for the first time.

[ FIXME: RE-WORK THIS WITH SCREENSHOTS BEGIN ]
The first time you run the program, GRAMPS will display its Getting Started
screens. GRAMPS will guide you through a few pages that prompt you for 
some setup information. The information it requests includes information about 
yourself and your preferences.

Although GRAMPS requests information about your, this information is used 
only so that it can create valid GEDCOM output files. A valid GEDCOM file 
requires information about the file's creator. If you chose, you may leave the 
information empty.

<	<	<Choosing a database on startup

If the GRAMPS is started without any database to open, the following window 
will appear prompting you to choose what database to open. (Figure 0: 
open existing or created new). If you would like to open an existing 
database, check the top radio button and click OK. You will then be asked 
to specify the name of your existing database. If you would like to start
creating your brand new database from scratch right away, choose new XML
database. 

<	<	<Optional ZODB support

If either StandaloneZODB or Zope is installed on your system, GRAMPS will give 
you the third option of creating a new ZODB database. You can choose to start
your new database in either XML or ZODB format. Both formats have their strong 
and weak points.

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and is a human readable sctructured
description of data. It could be easily parsed by other programs should the 
need occur. It stores only the data itself. Its weak point is the relatively 
low speed of processing large data files. 

ZODB stands for Zope Object Database and provides the full-fledged database 
support. ZODB files are not human readable. They contain a certain overhead
to assist working with large data structures. However, ZODB provides a 
significant speed-up when the database size is large (over few thousand 
people). 

Its is hard to tell which format is better, since this is a typical tradeoff 
situation. If you are starting your research then you are likely to be fine 
with the regular XML database. If you have tons of data to import describing 
thousands upon thousands of people, then you are probably better of with ZODB.

<Main Window

When you open a database (either existing or brand new), the following window 
is displayed: Figure 1, gramps - GRAMPS (example file loaded). 

<	<Menubar

The Menubar provides access to all features of GRAMPS through its menus. 

<	<Toolbar

The Toolbar provides access to the most frequently used functions of GRAMPS. 
The appearance of the Toolbar can be adjusted in the Preferences dialog.

<	<Progress bar

The Progress bar is located in the lower left corner of the GRAMPS window. 
It shows the progress of time consuming operations, such as opening and saving 
large data bases, importing and exporting to other formats, generating 
web-sites, etc. 

<	<Status line

The Status line is located to the right of the Progress bar, on the very bottom 
of the GRAMPS window. The behavior of the Status line can be adjusted in the 
Preferences dialog.

<	<Display area

The largest are in the center of the GRAMPS window is the Display area. 
It shows certain aspects of genealogical information, depending on the 
currently selected View. There are six Views available in GRAMPS: 
People, Family, Pedigree, Sources, Places, and Media. 

<	<Views

Views are the various ways to display different aspects of genealogical 
information, as described below. Since the relevant information is very broad 
and non-uniform in both context and modality, it is best to split it's display 
into smaller categories, uniform in context and modality. Each View represents
such a split and displays a certain portion of overall available information. 
Before the detailed description of available Views, let us  guide you through 
the ways of switching between the Views.

<	<	<Viewing Modes
<	<	<	<Sidebar vs Tabbed Interface

Depending on the state of the View->Sidebar menu item, the Views could be 
changed either in the Sidebar (Figure 2. Sidebar, no filter) or in the Notebook 
Tabs in the top part of the window (Figure 3. no sidebar, no filter). 
To switch the View, click on the desired Sidebar icon or the Notebook tab. 
To Switch between Sidebar and Notebook interfaces, choose View->Sidebar from 
the GRAMPS menu.

<	<	<People View

When GRAMPS opens a database, the View is set to the People View. 
People View lists individuals whose data is stored in the database.  
People View displays people's Names, GRAMPS ID numbers, Gender, and their 
Birth and Death dates. The list can be ordered by any field. Example: to order 
list by the Birth date, click on the Birth date column heading. To order list 
in reverse (descending) order, click one more time on the desired 
column heading. 

<	<	<	<Filters

Genealogical databases may contain huge numbers of people. Since the long 
lists are hard for humans to handle, GRAMPS provides a convenient way to limit 
the scope of browsing by using the Filter. To save screen space, Filter 
controls may be either displayed or not, depending on the state of View->Filter 
menu item. 

When GRAMPS opens a database, the Filter is set to the trivial filter 
called "All people", i.e. no filtering is in effect. To choose a filter, use a 
pop-up Filter menu above the people's list (Figure 4, sidebar, filter). Once 
the Filter is chosen, press apply button in the upper right corner of the 
window. The filtering will take effect upon pressing Apply. To invert 
the filtering rule, check the Invert check-box on the left of Apply button. 
Example: To show people without children, choose "People with children" Filter, 
then check Invert check-box, and then press Apply button. To cancel any 
filtering, set the Filter to "All People" and then press Apply button. 

Note: even if the Filter controls are not displayed (View->Edit menu item is 
unchecked), the filtering might still be in place. In other words, the 
visibility of the Filter controls is not related to the actual filtering 
imposed on the list. This may be a cause of confusion, when you enable the 
filtering and then remove the controls from the display. If in doubt, enable 
the display of Filter controls (by checking View->Edit menu item) and check 
what kind of filtering is currently set.

<	<	<	<Alphabetical Tabs

GRAMPS offers another way of managing long lists of people -- alphabetical 
tabs. Upon loading a database, GRAMPS checks for the stored Family names and 
breaks the people list into sublists based on the first letter of their name. 
The alphabetical tabs are displayed in the bottom part of the GRAMPS window. 
The last tab, "Other," stands for unidentified characters -- all the entries 
not assigned to any other tab end up in "Others."

<	<	<Family View

Family View displays the Family information of a currently selected 
(or Active) person. Specifically, this view shows the relationships (e.g 
marriages, partnerships, etc.) of the active person, his/her parents (or step 
parents, or guardians, etc), and his/her children (could be step children, 
adopted children, etc.). 

The Active person's data is in the list-box in the upper left corner of the 
window. Directly below it, another box lists the Spouse's data, for each 
relationship of Active person (can be more than one). The double-arrow button 
to the right of the Active person list-box allows to exchange the currently 
selected spouse (Current spouse) with the Active person. Double-clicking on 
the Active person allows to edit Active person's data. Double-clicking on the 
Current spouse allows to edit their relationship information. To add a spouse, 
press "+" button to the right of the spouse box. To remove Current spouse,
press "-" button to the right of the spouse box. 

The parents of both the Active person and the Current spouse are listed in 
the corresponding list-boxes in the right-hand part of the window (Active 
person's parents on top, Current spouse parents on the bottom). Both 
list-boxes have a set of three buttons on their right side. The "+" 
and "-" buttons allow to add and remove parents of the Active person and 
the Current spouse, respectively. Pressing the right arrow "->" button makes 
the family in the corresponding list-box and active family. That is, it makes 
the selected Father the Active person, and the selected Mother the Current 
spouse. 

The bottom list-box displays children of the Active person and the Current 
Spouse. Children's list can be order by the Birth date, by usual way of 
clicking on the Birth date column header. In addition to the Name, ID, Gender, 
and Birth date columns, the list includes Status column. The pair of status 
words reflect the relationship between the child and his Father/Mother 
(such as Birth, Adoption, etc.) The three buttons are available on the right 
side of the children list-box. The "+" and "-" buttons allow to add and remove 
children, respectively. Pressing the left arrow button "<-" makes the selected 
child the Active person.

<	<	<Pedigree View

Pedigree View helps to visualize the place of the Active person in the tree 
of its ancestors. Pedigree View shows four generations, going back in time 
from the Active person (1) to his/her parents (2), to grandparents (3), to 
great-grandparents (4). Each person is denoted by a white box bearing the 
person's name. The two lines that converge on the box represent ties with 
the person's Father (top line) and mother (bottom line). Solid lines 
represent birth relations, while dashed lines represent non-birth relations
(such as adoption, step-parentship, guardianship, etc.). When the mouse moves 
over the white box, it expands to display the corresponding person's dates 
of birth and death. When the mouse is placed over the family line, the 
line changes color to indicate an active link: double-clicking on the line 
makes the corresponding ancestor the Active person. The display in that case 
is re-adjusted to show four generations, starting from a newly selected 
Active person. 

The left-hand side of the window shows the left arrow button. Upon clicking, 
the button expands to the menu listing the children of the Active person. 
Selecting the menu item makes the corresponding child the Active person. 

The right-hand side of the window shows two right arrow buttons. When the 
top button is clicked, the Father of the Active person becomes Active person. 
Clicking the bottom button makes the Mother of the Active person the Active 
person. Again, the display is re-adjusted to show four generations, starting 
from a newly selected Active person.

<	<	<Sources View

Sources View lists the sources of information stored in the database. 
This can include various documents (birth, death, and marriage certificates, 
etc.), books, films, journals, private diaries, i.e. virtually anything that 
can be classified as a source of information. The sources can be used as the 
reference for any event stored in the database. The Source View lists the 
title, ID, and the author of the source. All the columns can be used for 
sorting the list. The usual rules apply: one click for ascending order, 
another click for descending order.

<	<	<Places View

Places View lists the geographical places in which the events of the database 
took place. These could be places of birth, death, marriages of people, as 
well as their home, employment, education addresses, or any other conceivable 
reference to the geographical location. The Places View lists places' Name, 
ID, Church Parish, City, County, State, and Country. All of these can be used 
for sorting by the usual sorting rules. 

<	<	<Media View

Media View is a list of Media Objects used in the database. Media Objects 
are any files that relate somehow to the stored genealogical data. 
Technically, any file can be stored as a Madia Object. Most frequently, 
these are images, audio files, animation files, etc. The list-box on the 
bottom lists the Name, ID, Type, and Path to the Media Object. The top part 
of the GRAMPS window shows the preview (if available) and the information 
about the Media Object.
