    <para>

    &app; is a software package designed to help you with
    genealogical resarch. It allows you to store, edit, and research
    genealogical data using your computer. Although similar to other
    genealogical programs, it offers some unique and powerful
    features.  GRAMPS is an open source software package, which means
    it's distributed for free. It's developed and maintained by a
    worldwide team of volunteers.

      <para> 
 
      Most genealogy programs allow the researcher to input
      information related to a family tree. They can usually display
      descendant or ancestral relationships through graphical
      displays, charts, or reports. Some allow pictures or other media
      to be inserted to enhance the raw data. Most provide a means to
      include data on individuals or familys that may or may not be
      related to the primary family being researched.  And they may
      include other features such as exporting or importing to and
      from other programs and printing data contained in various
      reports.

      </para><para>

      &app; has all these capabilities and more. Notably, it allows
      you to integrate bits and pieces of stray data as the arise from
      your research and put all this information in one place - your
      computer. You can then use the speed, power, and accuracy of
      your computer to store, manipulate, correlate, and analyze your
      data, rather than messing with reams of paper.

      </para><para>

      &app; has the power to let you rearrage your data in any order
      or sequence and to help you fill gaps in genealogical
      relationships.

        <title>What's new since 1.0.X</title>
        <para>
          
            This section lists most notable changes from the previous
            stable branch of &app;, the 1.0.X.

        </para>

      <variablelist>

      <varlistentry><term>Berkeley database backend</term>
	<listitem>
          <para>

            The default format for &app; is now the BSDDB database.
	    This change allowed us to overcome performance issues and
	    memory requirements of the 1.0.X branch. With the database
	    backend, the database sizes of up to a hundred thousand
	    people do not present a major obstacle any longer.

          </para><para>

	    The default extension for &app; BSDDB database files is
   	    grdb. The new format is open and fully documented in the
   	    developer's API reference distributed with the source of
   	    &app;.

	</para><para>

            A consequence of the new database backend is that the
            changes, once approved by the user, are applied
            immediately. In short, once you click
            <guibutton>OK</guibutton> in the Person, Family, Source,
            Place, Media object, or Event editor, all the changes made
            to this object are recorded in the database. No saving is
            necessary (or even possible). The analog of quitting
            without saving would be abandoning all changes and
            quitting. Also, it is possible to undo recent actions.

  	    There were numerous changes in the interface. Most of them

          <para>
	    Along with the BSDDB backend, the in-memory database handling 
            for &app; XML and GEDCOM formats has been added. Simply put, it 
            is now possible to natively open data in those two formats 
            (although the preferred and default format is grdb) and work with
 	    that data, without necessarily setting up an empty database and 
            then importing into it. This approach requires holding all data in 
            memory, so it is only useful for small databases (depending on the 
            available memory size). In such mode, the data is automatically
   	    saved upon exit, to mimic the functionality of the real database.

            <warning id="gedcom-inmem1-warn">
              <title>GEDCOM Editing</title>
	      <para>
		
		Please keep in mind that some information in GEDCOM
		file may be lost during import into &app;. Simply
		opening and viewing the file will not change it.
		However, if any changes were made and they were not
		abandoned upon exit, exiting &app; will save the data,
		with the possible data loss.

	    A new report -- Statistics Chart -- has been added to &app;.
	  </para><para>
            An overall change of the whole report framework has been
	    acomplished.  All reports now remember their options. It
	    is possible to generate reports from the command line,
	    without launching the interactive &app; session. The
	    report API is much simpler now, making it easy to write
	    custom report. A single code instance may be used for a
	    standalone report, a book item, and a command-line
	    report.

          <para> 
            The new command line functionality includes opening the
	    filename argument given without any flags, as well as new
	    flags and options for report generation.  Also, the
	    addition of new formats leads to addition of available
	    format options.

        <term>Internationalization</term>
	<listitem>
          <para>
  	    The approach for entering and displaying dates has been
            completely re-worked. In particular, the new framework
            allows for a deeper localization of displayed dates than
            was ever possible using the translatable strings.
          </para><para>
            The internationalization of names have also been improved.
            Names can be grouped under a non-default
            string. Patronymic names are supported, and it is easy to
            program new ways on displaying names, as may be required
            by various cultures and languages.

        <term>Desktop integration</term>
	<listitem>
          <para>
            All formats known to &app; are now registered as mime
	    types, each with its icon and &app; as a default
	    handler. Double-clicking on a file with any of these
	    formats will launch &app; and open that file. &app; also
	    added support for the recent documents
	    functionailty. This is on both the GNOME-wide level
	    and within the &app;.  
          </para><para>
            The preferences are now properly stored using GConf, with
	    schemas, partitioning of keys into smaller directories,
	    error checking, and notification.
