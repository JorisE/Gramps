    <P

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GRAMPS</TT
> is an acronym for the
    Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System.
    It was conceived under the concept that most genealogy programs
    were designed to provide the researcher the capability to input
    information related to a particular family tree.  Most of these
    programs have allowed for the arranging and storing of information
    consistent with the GEDCOM standards.  They usually provide a
    means for displaying descendant or ancestral relationships by
    means of graphical displays, charts, or reports.  These may be
    augmented with pictures or other media to enhance the data.  Most
    provide for inputting data on unconnected individuals/families
    that may or may not have a relationship to the primary surname
    being researched.  Various other enhancements may also be provided
    in the genealogical program that allows for different degrees of
    importing and exporting data from other programs and printing of
    the data contained in the various reports.  GRAMPS, on the other
    hand, attempts to provide all of the common capabilities of these
    programs, but, more importantly, to provide a capability not
    common to these programs.  This is the ability to input any bits
    and pieces of information directly into GRAMPS and
    rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base
    (in any order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research,
    analysis and correlation with the potential of filling
    relationship gaps.  In short, a tool that provides a way to input
    all your research into one place and do your analysis and
    correlation using the speed, power, and accuracy of your computer
    instead of pencils and unmanageable reams of paper.
