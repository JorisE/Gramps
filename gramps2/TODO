* Remember where the images are added from (RFE 748974). This is actually 
  very useful when you add 50 new images -- navigating 50 times to the same 
  place is a nightmare. All that's needed is keeping track of a single 
  last selected directory and then point gtk.FileSellector there.

* Presense of Notes for a person/event/whatever_else. RFE 747527 suggested 
  either a column in the People View or something like boldfaces "Notes" 
  tab title. I like the latter because it can be uniformly applied to 
  any notes, not only people's. Not so hard to implement. 

* Allow for multiple notes. A tabbed interface would be really useful,
  since there are no titles for notes. Not all objects would necessarily
  need multiple notes. Determine which ones should and shouldn't.
* Speed up the reading of the database. The python XML routines are not
  as fast as I would like, and it can take a minute or so to read a
  large database. This is way too slow.
* Finish the generic load of revision control interfaces to allow a
  revision control plugin system. Most of the work is already done.
* Disable the save buttons if gramps database is marked read-only. Disable 
  the adding of media objects as well, since this will cause gramps to
  try to create a thumbnail in a readonly database.
* Startup tips.
* And a whole lot more....
