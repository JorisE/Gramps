* Allow for multiple notes. A tabbed interface would be really useful,
  since there are no titles for notes. Not all objects would necessarily
  need multiple notes. Determine which ones should and shouldn't.
=== THESE should be obsoleted once we move to a database
* Speed up the reading of the database. The python XML routines are not
  as fast as I would like, and it can take a minute or so to read a
  large database. This is way too slow.
* Finish the generic load of revision control interfaces to allow a
  revision control plugin system. Most of the work is already done.
* Disable the save buttons if gramps database is marked read-only. Disable 
  the adding of media objects as well, since this will cause gramps to
  try to create a thumbnail in a readonly database.

* Startup tips.
* Date calculator.
  See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3252078&forum_id=1993
* Add string substitutions for web page generation (name, report name,
  date, etc).
* Add support for sources of the parent/child relation
* Add support for storing reliability (confidence) of the marriage information; 
  see http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3066997&forum_id=1993 
  and http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3134931&forum_id=1993
  for the details.
* Make Date parsing locale dependent, like relationship calculator
* Add Confession as a standard event
* Now that the completeness flag exists, create filters that are using it
  (both individual and family). 
* Introduce format attribute for the notes (Flowed or Preformatted).
* Add ZIP/Postal code to Places
* Add Phone as an attribute for Addresses and Places
* Add FAX too? Maybe rather a property of Phone 
  (one of: Home, Work, Mobile, FAX, etc).
* Add Phone as a standard personal and family attribute
* Add Award as a standard personal (and family?) attribute
* Add an option to add media from gallery (like TitlePage in BookReport).
  Currently it has to be done via DnD, which is hard for small displays.
  The selector is already there waiting anyway ;-)
* Add autofill feature for City, Church parish, County, State and Country? 
* And a whole lot more....
