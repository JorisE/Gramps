      <term>Memory size and performance</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The known limitations include the BSDDB performance issues related
        to caching and the memory size. As long as the BSDDB cache fits completely
        into the available memory on the system, the performance should be
        adequate. When the cache size exceeds that of the free memory and
        portions of database cache start to be swapped onto the disk, the performance
        degrades appreciably. This can be solved by adjusting the BSDDB cache
        size for the large databases.</para>

        <para>Please keep in mind that some information in GEDCOM file may be
        lost during import into GRAMPS. Simply opening and viewing the file
        will not change it. However, if any changes were made and they were
        not abandoned upon exit, exiting GRAMPS will save the data, with the
        possible data loss.</para>
