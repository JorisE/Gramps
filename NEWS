Version 0.1.4

* Implemented date ranges.  Valid forms are "from <date> to <date>" and
  "between <date> and <date>".
* Better support for partial dates.  A question mark can optionally be 
  used for a placeholder for a year if the year is unknown.  Illegal 
  date formats issue a warning upon an attempt to save the date.
* Start of internationalization (i18n) support.  Had to include a single
  C file to allow libglade to understand translations.  This means that
  binary releases are no longer going to be platform independant.
* Start of a generic output formatter for report generation. Currently
  supports HTML, OpenOffice (625+), and AbiWord (0.7.13+).  Allows 
  control of paragraph and font styles.

Version 0.1.3

* Allow the user to specifiy their preferred numerical date input format,
  either DD/MM/YY or MM/DD/YY on the preferences dialog box.
* Handles file problems a bit more gracefully.
* Use ISO-8859-1 character set instead of ASCII to support languages other
  than English.  Eventually this should go to unicode, but python 1.5.2
  does not have good unicode support.  Python 2.X/Gnome 2.X will be the 
  migration for this feature.
* Handle ANSEL encoding for import and exporting GEDCOM files.
* Fixed a bug in the selection of parents, which did not accept new parents
  if previous parents did not exist.

Version 0.1.2

* Allow the user the option to display alternate names in the person
  list. Alternate names in the list have an '*' appended to the end
  of the name.
* Merge function now gives the user the option of saving the name of
  the merged individual as an alternate name if the names are not 
  the same.
* Added the "Alternate Birth" and "Alternate Death" to the event list, 
  to allow other birthdates to be recorded. Gramps makes a distinction
  between the birthdate/deathdate and the alternates.
* GEDCOM import and export adapted to load/save alternate birth and
  death dates.  The first "BIRT" and "DEAT" tags are the ones used
  for the primary dates, the others are loaded as alternates.
* Added the ability to store web page addresses for each person. From
  the edit person page, the "Go" button brings up a web browser to
  display the page.
* Fixed a bug in the relationship calculator that caused a traceback
  when the person selected was a direct ancestor of the active person.
* Added the suffix field to the alternate name entry on the Edit Person
  form.
