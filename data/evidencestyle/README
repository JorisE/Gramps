* Original evidence_style downloaded from 
  http://jytangledweb.org/genealogy/evidencestyle/ which are given there
  for use in genealogy programs

* Several fixes done in the csv file which I believe were errors

* Run

  $ python evidencefield.py

  to generate two files with python code usable in srcattrtype.py in Gramps.

* If in the future one wants to insert _NEW_ evidence styles, add them at the 
  bottom of the csv file, generate the data, and copy to srcattrtype.py

* CAREFUL: When adding or changing things, DON'T change the type of already 
  released versions in Gramps! That means the integer indexes used must remain
  the same! If only styles are added at the bottom and no lines removed, 
  this should not be a problem.
