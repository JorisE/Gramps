* Dates do not understand alternate calendars
* There are no sophisticated functions at all yet, such as merging of 
  databases or finding duplicate people.  
* There are no logic rules yet, such as warning if a parent's birthday 
  is after a child's.
* OpenOffice zip file is not handled very gracefully.  Uses the "system"
  call to generate the zip file using the hard coded path of /usr/bin/zip. 
  Python 2.0 provides a zip interface, so this may need to hold off until 
  the move is made to Python 2.0.
* Sort all lists
* And a whole lot more....
