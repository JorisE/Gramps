* Allow for multiple notes. A tabbed interface would be really useful,
  since there are no titles for notes. Not all objects would necessarily
  need multiple notes. Determine which ones should and shouldn't.
* Drag and drop should display the icon we are dragging instead of just
  the default icon.  Nautilus does this very effectively, and GTK has
  support for this.
* Speed up the reading of the database. The python XML routines are not
  as fast as I would like, and it can take a minute or so to read a
  large database. This is way too slow.
* Finish the generic load of revision control interfaces to allow a
  revision control plugin system. Most of the work is already done.
* Disable the save buttons if gramps database is marked read-only. Disable 
  the adding of media objects as well, since this will cause gramps to
  try to create a thumbnail in a readonly database.
* Startup tips.
* And a whole lot more....
