* On multiple notes: 
    --> A GrampsWidget for use in report dialogs to select which notetypes to include 
        in a report (a filter?).
    --> Support for multiple notes in all reports.
    --> Empty text field on Saving Note should throw an error that Note is empty ! (?)
    --> Undo in Note. Serious editing needs an undo function. Furthermore, the function
        the Clear icon is unclear: tooltip? Other icon?

* Remove import of global var in __init__.py, use functions or don't export. Eg.
  PluginUtils/__init__.py export of plugin lists (tool_list, ...).

* Add string substitutions for web page generation (name, report name,
  date, etc).

* Add support for sources of the parent/child relation

* Add support for storing reliability (confidence) of the marriage
