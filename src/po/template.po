"Welcome to the 2.0.x series of GRAMPS!\n"
"\n"
"This version drastically differs from the 1.0.x branch\n"
"in a few ways. Please read carefully, as this may affect\n"
"the way you are using the program.\n"
"\n"
"1. This version works with the Berkeley database backend.\n"
"   Because of this, changes are written to disk immediately.\n"
"   There is NO Save function anymore!\n"
"2. The Media object files are not managed by GRAMPS.\n"
"   There is no concept of local objects, all objects\n"
"   are external. You are in charge of keeping track of\n"
"   your files. If you delete the image file from disk,\n"
"   it will be lost!\n"
"3. The version control provided by previous GRAMPS\n"
"   versions has been removed. You may set up the versioning\n"
"   system on your own if you'd like, but it will have to be\n"
"   outside of GRAMPS.\n"
"4. It is possible to directly open GRAMPS XML databases\n"
"   (used by previous versions) as well as GEDCOM files.\n"
"   However, any changes will be written to the disk when\n"
"   you quit GRAMPS. In case of GEDCOM files, this may lead\n"
"   to a data loss because some GEDCOM files contain data\n"
"   that does not comply with the GEDCOM standard and cannot\n"
"   be parsed by GRAMPS. If unsure, set up an empty grdb\n"
"   database (new GRAMPS format) and import GEDCOM into it.\n"
"   This will keep the original GEDCOM untouched.\n"
"\n"
