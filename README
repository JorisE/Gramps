Please read the COPYING file first.

Requirements
--------------------------------
Python 1.5.2 or greater
Gnome 1.2 or greater
PyGnome 1.0.53 or greater

If you are using python 1.5.2, you may also need PyXML 0.6.2 or
greater. Many distributions already provide this, but if your
installation does not have it, you can get it from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473

Documentation
---------------------------------
Gramps documentation is supplied in the form of SGML files, which will be
installed in the GNOME help path(*).  Recent versions of Nautilus and Galeon
can generate HTML documents on-the-fly from these.  To generate distinct
HTML documentation follow these steps:

1) Ensure the following packages are installed:
db2html >= 0.6.9  (jw >= 1.1)  to convert the SGML -> HTML
gnome-doc-tools-2-1            for the GNOME documentation style sheets
The /etc/sgml/catalog file should contain an entry pointing to PNG support.
If configured properly, your db2html should automatically look up and use
the /etc/sgml/catalog file.  If it doesn't you can try editing the DB2HTML
line in Makefile.comm to explicitly use that file,
DB2HTML = db2html -c /etc/sgml/catalog

2) Invoke configure with the --enable-html option: 
   ./configure --enable-html

3) In addition to the normal 'make' and 'make install', you need to also
execute 'make html && make install-html'.

If all goes well and you do the happy dance, the HTML files should be
built and installed successfully.  Due to a wide variation in the
implementation of db2html (and docbook-utils) across various Linux
distributions, though, this is not guaranteed to work.  Some configure-time
checks are in place, and it _should_ work, but it is very ad-hoc at the
moment.  You have been warned. :-)

Of course, current HTML documentation can also be found on the gramps website,
http://gramps.sourceforge.net/help.html

(*) More precisely, they are installed in ${prefix}/share/gnome/help, where
${prefix} is given by the --prefix= option to configure.  If this is
different from where your standard GNOME installation looks for help files
and documentation, then set your GNOMEDIR environment variable to the
${prefix} path before starting gramps. For example, if you are installing
gramps in /usr/local/, then type the following:
in tcsh: setenv GNOMEDIR /usr/local/
in bash: GNOMEDIR=/usr/local/ ; export GNOMEDIR


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------

Linux has libintl (GNU gettext) built-in the C library. Other systems
are likely to have libintl as a separate or optional library. Also,
other systems may have a different make utility.

On those systems, like FreeBSD, you must tell configure where to find
the libintl library and the libintl.h include file:

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Once you have done this, if make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD
gives to GNU make) instead.
