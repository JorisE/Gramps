Requirements
--------------------------------
Python 1.5.2 or greater
Gnome 1.2 or greater
PyGnome 1.0.53 or greater

If you are using python 1.5.2, you may also need PyXML 0.6.2 or
greater. Many distributions already provide this, but if your
installation does not have it, you can get it from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473

Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------

Linux has libintl (GNU gettext) built-in the C library. Other systems
are likely to have libintl as a separate or optional library. Also,
other systems may have a different make utility.

On those systems, like FreeBSD, you must tell configure where to find
the libintl library and the libintl.h include file:

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Once you have done this, if make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD
gives to GNU make) instead.
