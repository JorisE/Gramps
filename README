Please read the COPYING file first.
If building from source, also read the INSTALL file (at least through the
"SUPER-SHORT VERSION") before going further.

Requirements
--------------------------------
The following packages *MUST* be installed in order for Gramps to work:
   Python 2.2 or greater
   Gnome 2.0 or greater
   PyGTK2 1.99.14 or greater
   PyXML 0.7.1 or greater

Many distributions already provide PyXML, but if your
installation does not have it, you can get it from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6473

The following packages are *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to be installed:
   Reportlab         Enable creation of PDF documents 
                     http://www.reportlab.com

   Python Imaging Library (PIL)
                    Enable generation of thumbnails for images
                    http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil

Documentation
---------------------------------
Gramps documentation is supplied in the form of XML files, which will be
installed in the GNOME help path(*).  Gnome help browser (Yelp) uses these 
(properly installed) XML files to display the documentation.

Of course, current HTML documentation can also be found on the gramps website,
http://gramps.sourceforge.net/help.html

(*) More precisely, they are installed 
in ${prefix}/share/gramps/gnome/help/gramps, 
where ${prefix} is given by the --prefix= option 
to configure (defaults to /usr).  


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------

Linux has libintl (GNU gettext) built-in the C library. Other systems
are likely to have libintl as a separate or optional library. Also,
other systems may have a different make utility.

On those systems, like FreeBSD, you must tell configure where to find
the libintl library and the libintl.h include file:

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Once you have done this, if make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD
gives to GNU make) instead.
